                        A sender conveys scarce information to a number of receivers to maximize the sum of receiver payoffs. 
                        Each receiver’s payoff depends on the state of the world and an action she takes. 
                        The optimal action is state contingent. Under mild regularity conditions, we show that the payoff of each receiver is convex in the amount of information she receives. 
                        Thus, it is optimal for Sender to target information to a single receiver. We then study four extensions in which interior information allocations are optimal.</p>

                            We study the impact of a dominant incumbent’s acquisition on entry and R&D incentives in a model with multiple start-ups. 
                            The incumbent’s acquisition directly suppresses entry and can distort the non-target start-up’s R&D incentives by creating a kill zone. 
                            The reduced threat of entry can also cause the incumbent to shelve the acquired technology. Despite these negative effects, acquisitions generally affect consumer welfare ambiguously due to synergy benefits. 
                            We study the design of merger policies aimed at minimizing acquisition-related harms. 
                            We also show that entry-for-buyout may not be a valid defense for startup acquisitions when accounting for non-target start-ups.

                            This paper explores the relationship between market accessibility and various participants’ welfare in an intermediated directed-search market. 
                            For a general class of meeting technologies, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition under which efficiency requires imperfect accessibility, such that each seller’s listing is only observed by some but not all buyers. 
                            We show that the platform optimally implements the efficient outcome, but fully extracts surplus from the transactions it intermediates. We also find that in general, buyers prefer to minimize market accessibility, while sellers prefer a weakly greater accessibility level than that which is socially efficient. 
                            The efficiency of imperfect accessibility is robust to the introduction of a second chance for unmatched buyers to search.

                        <p class="abstract">
                            A company makes a take-it-or-leave-it offer to hire a worker. The worker observes the offer, then decides whether to upskill at a cost. 
                            Upskilling raises the worker's quality in expectation, which determines her outside option value and the company's hiring benefit. 
                            The worker observes a signal of her quality before accepting or rejecting the offer. 
                            The efficiency of the outcome is undermined by the adverse selection problem in hiring, and the worker's moral hazard in upskilling. 
                            We show that information structures which support second-best outcomes balance both inefficiencies, by leaving the worker fully informed if she takes the outside option, and moderately pessimistic if she works for the company. 
                            Also, second-best outcomes which favour the worker yield lower total welfare and less upskilling, and the Pareto-frontier may be non-concave. 
                            Thus, small changes in an information designer's preferences over outcomes can lead to large changes in the worker's information. 
                            Our results are robust to varying the match between the worker's skills and company's benefit, and the timing of upskilling.

                        <p class="abstract">
                            I study the information design problem when receivers’ behaviour in the Bayesian game induced by the designer’s choice of information structure coincides with Level-K thinking. 
                            I characterise outcomes which describe Level-K behaviour under some information structure both for a given distribution over receivers’ levels of thinking, and those fully implemented regardless of receivers’ levels of thinking. 
                            I apply my results to study the information design problem in coordination games for a designer who anticipates facing receivers exactly at Level K. 
                            I show that if receivers always have a dominant strategy in the absence of uncertainty, then the designer's optimal information structure possesses a natural infection property, and the designer's payoff is constant in K at some finite K. 
                            I also provide an alternative rationale for the role of public information: as a hedge against cognitive uncertainty.
